****  NEVER USE EM UNIT FOR FONT SIZE  *****

Depends on the font size of immediate parent ( if that has a font size set)

Keeps cascading as nesting elements increases
  >> more nesting more dramatic increase in font size of child elements

  Good use of EM is padding on button designs ( a tag or input tag or the button tag)
  Also for RELATIVE MARGINS BETWEEN TWO OR MORE ELEMENTS(H1, H2 P etc) ( NOT FOR WHOLE PAGE)
